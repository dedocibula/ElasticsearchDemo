#   LESSON No. 3    #    
#####################

# So you made it this far, congrats
# In this lesson we will focus on some more fancy
# features as are mere searches
# We will have a look at aggregation framework
# and some highlighting

# Once again, you will be using Stack Overflow

# 1
# Lets start with aggregating answers by their ratings
# Note that result size is 0. We don't want to display
# results, just aggregations
GET /dba/answer/_search
{
  "size": 0, 
  "aggs": {
    "ratings": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "rating"
      }
    }
  }
}

# 2
# You can naturally combine aggregations with queries
GET /dba/answer/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "python OR ruby"
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "ratings": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "rating"
      }
    }
  }
}

# 3
# Now let's do something more advanced - like nested
# aggregations. Let's try aggregating questions by tags
# and for each value let's calculate average rating
GET /dba/question/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "tags": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "tags"
      }, 
      "aggs": {
        "rating": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "rating"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# 4
# Great. Now let us aggregate question by tags while
# displaying number of comments for each "bucket"
GET /dba/question/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "tags": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "tags"
      }, 
      "aggs": {
        "nested": {
          "nested": {
            "path": "comments"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# 5
# The last thing we want to show you is highlighting
# Sometimes, we want elasticseach to let us know
# why particular query has been highlighted
# For this purpose we can use highlight keyword that
# essentially adds new field to our result set with
# matched keywords in bold. Try this example and look
# for highlight attribute
GET /dba/answer/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "body": {
        "query": "uninstall windows", 
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "body": {}
    }
  }
}

# Congratulations

# You have reached the end of our lessons. Now you
# know enough to experiment with ES and to further
# your knowledge even more. 
# Thanks again for your attention
